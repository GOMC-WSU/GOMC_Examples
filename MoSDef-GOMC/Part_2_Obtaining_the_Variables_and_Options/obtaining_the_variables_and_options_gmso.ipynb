WARNING: THE tag_ID_integer VALUES MUST BE UNIQUE FOR EACH SUBVOLUME, OR THE DICTIONARY WILL OVERWRITE THE PREVIOUS SUBVOLUME (tag_ID_integer) SECTION WITH THE CURRENT tag_ID_integer AND ITS RESPECTIVE VALUES.

The type of targeted swap box (subvolume) that will be created. The \"static\" type will maintain the box (subvolume) in a fixed location during the whole simulation, with the center of the box determined by the coordinates set in the \"SubVolumeCenter\" parameter. The \"dynamic\" type will allow for dynamic movement of the box (subvolume) based atom indices provided in the SubvolumeCenterList variable. For the \"dynamic\" type, the user must define a list of atom indices using \"SubVolumeCenterList\" keyword; the geometric center of the provided atom indices will be used as the center of subVolume.
