# MoSDeF-dihedral-fit: OPLS-AA CT-CT-C-OH in COOH dihedral fit example
This CT-CT-C-OH dihedral is an example of how the other opposite dihedral (CT-CT-C-O_3) can be set to zero while fitting the CT-CT-C-OH dihedral.
In this case, it allows the fitting of one (1) dihedral to cover both dihedral's interactions.
